============================
Partial Prerendering
_ What is prerendering?
 + When a server receives a request, it renders the page and sends the result back to the client. If a new request comes in, the server renders the page again. We call this end-of the spectrum dynamic rendering because the page is rendered on-demand for every incoming request.
Pages that personalize content based on runtime information or frequently updated data require this per-request rendering because each render produces a different result.

For example, a company's blog might produce the same result every time it's rendered.
- We can optimize this subset of pages by doing the rendering work ahead of time.
- We call this end-of-the-spectrum prerendering or static rendering.
Instead of dynamically rendering the page on every request at runtime, we can prerender the page once at build time and push the result to a content Delivery Network.When a prerended page is requested, the static result is served from an Edge Region close to the user rather than a runtime server.

+++ Server-side rendering, Static Site Generation, Client-side rendering, or Backend API Endpoints

++ Next.js grew in popularity partly because it offered more rendering diversity.
We can't prerender a page that depends on runtime information before receiving the request that contains that information.

It allows us to combine the benefits and abilities of prerendering and dynamic rendering on the same page.

How does it work?
As a reminder, Next.js currently prerenders a page at build time unless it uses dynamic APIs like incoming request headers or uncached data requests. and opt the whole page into dynamic rendering at runtime. 



[+] In a static route, components are rendered on the server at build time. The result of the work is cached are reused on subsequent requests.
[+] In a dynamic route, components are rendered on the server at request time.
